# Playwright Typescript Demo

I plan to create a playwright-demo repository showing off different features of playwright.

If you want to run this on your local machine, git clone the repo to local. In the main directory run the below command. This will install playwright dependencies on your machine.

To see progress <https://github.com/BMayhew/playwright-demo/projects/1>

```bash
npx playwright install
```

To run the script (this isn't really a test as I'm not making any assertions). Note: headed will open up browser for you to see the interactions nad hear the sounds.

```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```
